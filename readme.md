## 🏙️ Real-Life Project: Community Problem Identification & ICT-Based Solution

### 📌 Problem Identified: Poor Waste Management in *[Your Community Name]*

Many communities struggle with:
- Overflowing garbage bins  
- Illegal dumping  
- Environmental pollution  

There’s often no easy way for residents to report issues or for authorities to monitor waste collection efficiently.


## 💡 Our ICT-Based Solution: Smart Waste Management System

We designed a simple yet effective web-based solution using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.


## 🔑 Key Features
